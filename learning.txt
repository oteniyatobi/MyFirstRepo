What I have learned from this course

so far in the alx pathway programme i have learnt how to piortize pple in my environmrnt through empathy
One thing Iâ€™ve learned so far in this course is the importance of effective project management tools like Trello and Asana. Before this course, I often relied on mental notes or basic to-do lists, which made it hard to track progress or stay organized. Learning how to break down tasks, assign deadlines, and visually monitor progress has helped me become more structured and focused. I now understand how planning and organizing work can reduce stress and increase productivity, especially when working on larger or collaborative projects.
